            <!-- Information about SP -->
            The Ministry of Education in Singapore has jurisdiction over Singapore Polytechnic, a post-secondary
            educational institution and statutory board. SP, founded in 1954, is Singapore's first and oldest polytechnic.
            Singapore Polytechnic began in the heart of Singapore's business sector. Today, the polytechnic is
            conveniently placed on Dover Road, amid the educational belt and science hub of Singapore's western region.
            SP graduates have made important contributions to Singapore's economic and industrial success, and several
            are now well-known entrepreneurs. Others hold positions of responsibility and leadership in business,
            industry, and government.</p>

                <!-- Description of waste management and recycling -->
                SP has created technology and procedures to improve e-waste and solar panel recycling, allowing valuable
                materials to be recovered rather than burnt. Some of these advances save costs by up to 20% when compared
                to traditional approaches. Furthermore, the school has strategically placed recycling bins throughout the
                campus, promoting recycling activities among students and staff. SP also undertakes educational programs
                and workshops to create awareness about trash reduction and recycling.

                on its grounds. These green spaces serve several functions, including aesthetic appeal, an enjoyable place
                to learn, and biodiversity promotion. SP exhibits its dedication to environmental sustainability by
                combining different types of vegetation and employing sustainable landscaping strategies. These changes not
                only improve the campus atmosphere but also provide youngsters with excellent educational opportunities.
